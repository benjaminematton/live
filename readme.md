1. **React Native Mobile App**  
   - Cross-platform UI for iOS and Android.  
   - Handles user input, schedule views, and calls to the Java back end.

2. **Java Spring Boot Back End**  
   - Provides RESTful APIs for user authentication, schedule creation, editing, and retrieval.  
   - Integrates with ChatGPT (OpenAI API) to generate or refine schedules.  
   - Communicates with the PostgreSQL database to persist user info, schedules, and activities.

3. **PostgreSQL Database**  
   - Relational database for storing users, schedules, activities, friendships, and more.  
   - Strong consistency (ACID) and ease of modeling relational data (one-to-many relationships, etc.).

4. **ChatGPT (LLM)**  
   - Used for intelligent suggestions: filling in missing schedule details, proposing itineraries, and refining user plans.  
   - Accessed securely from the back end via the OpenAI API.

## Languages & Technologies

1. **Java (Spring Boot)**  
   - Back-end REST APIs and business logic.  
   - Spring Data JPA for PostgreSQL integration.  
   - Spring Security (optional) for handling authentication/authorization (JWT or session-based).

2. **JavaScript or TypeScript (React Native)**  
   - Front-end/mobile development.  
   - Single codebase targeting iOS and Android.  
   - Libraries like React Navigation for screen management, and Axios or Fetch for HTTP requests.

3. **SQL (PostgreSQL)**  
   - Storing structured data (users, schedules, activities, friendships).  
   - Good fit for relational data models and transactions.

4. **OpenAI (ChatGPT)**  
   - For generating schedules or refining partial data.  
   - Typically integrated in the Spring Boot service layer with secure API calls.

## Required Features

### 1. User Onboarding & Authentication
- **Registration** (email, username, password) with validation  
- **Login** (JWT or session-based)  
- **Profile Management** (view, edit profile, upload profile picture)

### 2. Home Page / Dashboard
- **Upcoming Schedules**: Displays user’s next few schedules with quick details  
- **Trending / Social** (Optional): See popular itineraries, events, or friends’ schedules

### 3. Schedule Creation & Editing
- **Form Mode**: Collect exact date/time, activity details, or select broad categories (e.g., “dinner”)  
- **Free-Text Mode**: User provides a descriptive prompt; ChatGPT returns a proposed itinerary  
- **LLM Integration**: Missing details automatically filled by ChatGPT (e.g., picking a restaurant)  
- **Refinement**: User can manually edit or prompt ChatGPT to adjust the schedule

### 4. Schedule Viewing & Management
- **Schedule Detail Page**: Day-by-day or hour-by-hour breakdown of activities  
- **Activity Editing**: Rename, reschedule, or delete activities as needed  
- **Sharing** (Optional): Public link or share with friends; define visibility (public, friends-only, private)

### 5. LLM (ChatGPT) Integration
- **Generate Itineraries**: The back end crafts prompts from user data; ChatGPT returns structured plans  
- **Refine Existing Plans**: Modify times, add/remove activities, or change venue types based on user feedback

### 6. Social Features (Optional)
- **Friends / Following**: Add friends, view their public schedules  
- **Likes / Comments**: Interact with trending schedules or friend itineraries

### 7. Notifications (Optional)
- **Push Notifications**: Reminders for upcoming events (e.g., dinner reservation at 7 PM)  
- **Email / SMS**: If desired, to notify users of changes or reminders

### 8. Security & Performance
- **Authentication**: Spring Security with JWT or sessions  
- **Database Indexing**: Optimize queries on user IDs, schedule dates  
- **Scalability**: Potential use of load balancers, containerization (Docker), managed DB services  
- **Rate Limiting**: Control frequent LLM API usage if needed

## Summary

1. **Architecture**:  
   React Native (front end) ↔ Java Spring Boot (back end) ↔ PostgreSQL (data) ↔ ChatGPT (LLM)

2. **Languages**:  
   Java for Spring Boot, JavaScript/TypeScript for React Native, SQL for PostgreSQL

3. **Required Features**:  
   - **User Auth**  
   - **Schedule Creation/Editing** (with LLM help)  
   - **Schedule Viewing**  
   - **Optional Social/Trending Feeds**  
   - **Robust Security** (authentication, authorization, data validation)

This stack provides a **solid foundation** for building an intelligent scheduling application with a modern mobile front end, a reliable back end in Java, and AI-driven itinerary planning courtesy of ChatGPT.
